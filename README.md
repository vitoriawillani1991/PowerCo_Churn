# Churn Model: Price Sensitivity as a Driver of Churn
![churn](https://www.commonground.digital/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Customer-Churn.webp)
## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a churn model that aims to understand whether price sensitivity is the largest driver of customer churn. The project team from BCG believes that exploring the relationship between customer churn and price sensitivity could provide valuable insights for the client. To achieve this, we will perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided datasets to uncover initial patterns, trends, and potential correlations.
In this project, we used advanced machine learning techniques to create a reliable churn prediction model. The major goal was to identify consumers who were on the verge of leaving, allowing firms to take proactive actions to keep them. We are delighted to inform that our model has produced amazing results, with an outstanding accuracy rate of 0.98 in forecasting churn.



## Data

The dataset provided for this analysis includes three main components:

1. **Historical Customer Data:** This dataset contains information about customers, including usage patterns, sign-up dates, forecasted usage, and other relevant details.

2. **Historical Pricing Data:** This dataset includes information about pricing, both variable and fixed, associated with different customers.

3. **Churn Indicator:** This binary indicator specifies whether each customer has churned or not.

## EDA Objectives

The primary objectives of this EDA are as follows:

1. **Data Understanding:** Gain insights into the structure and content of the datasets. Understand the features, data types, and potential data quality issues.

2. **Exploring Churn Patterns:** Investigate the churn indicator to determine the overall churn rate and any initial patterns related to customer churn.

3. **Price Sensitivity Analysis:** Examine the relationship between pricing information and churn. Are there indications that price changes might influence churn behavior?

4. **Usage Patterns:** Analyze historical customer usage patterns and identify any correlations with churn.

## EDA Steps

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Load the provided datasets into a suitable environment for analysis. Handle missing data, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the data.

2. **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate summary statistics for relevant variables. This will help in understanding the basic distribution of data and identifying potential issues.

3. **Churn Rate Calculation:** Compute the churn rate by dividing the number of churned customers by the total number of customers. Visualize the churn rate to get a clear picture.

4. **Price Sensitivity Analysis:** Explore how pricing metrics relate to churn. Plot visualizations to understand the impact of pricing changes on churn behavior.

5. **Usage Patterns Exploration:** Create visualizations to uncover usage patterns. Are there specific usage behaviors that are associated with higher churn rates?

6. **Correlation Analysis:** Perform correlation analysis between churn and various features like pricing, usage, and sign-up dates. Identify which factors might be strongly correlated with churn.

7. **Data Visualization:** Create informative graphs and plots to present the findings visually. Visualizations could include histograms, scatter plots, line charts, and heatmaps.

## Implications for Business

The ramifications of such high forecasting accuracy for corporations are considerable. Companies can proactively deploy targeted retention measures by properly identifying consumers who may churn in the near future. This can include individualized discounts, better customer service, or targeted marketing initiatives, all with the goal of reducing churn and guaranteeing long-term client pleasure.
## Conclusion

Our 0.98 accuracy rate in churn prediction demonstrates the ability of advanced machine learning techniques in addressing crucial business concerns. This approach is a significant asset for any company looking to reduce customer turnover and increase customer loyalty.
