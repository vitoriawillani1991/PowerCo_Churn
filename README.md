# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Churn Model: Price Sensitivity as a Driver of Churn

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a churn model that aims to understand whether price sensitivity is the largest driver of customer churn. The project team from BCG believes that exploring the relationship between customer churn and price sensitivity could provide valuable insights for the client. To achieve this, we will perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided datasets to uncover initial patterns, trends, and potential correlations.

## Data

The dataset provided for this analysis includes three main components:

1. **Historical Customer Data:** This dataset contains information about customers, including usage patterns, sign-up dates, forecasted usage, and other relevant details.

2. **Historical Pricing Data:** This dataset includes information about pricing, both variable and fixed, associated with different customers.

3. **Churn Indicator:** This binary indicator specifies whether each customer has churned or not.

## EDA Objectives

The primary objectives of this EDA are as follows:

1. **Data Understanding:** Gain insights into the structure and content of the datasets. Understand the features, data types, and potential data quality issues.

2. **Exploring Churn Patterns:** Investigate the churn indicator to determine the overall churn rate and any initial patterns related to customer churn.

3. **Price Sensitivity Analysis:** Examine the relationship between pricing information and churn. Are there indications that price changes might influence churn behavior?

4. **Usage Patterns:** Analyze historical customer usage patterns and identify any correlations with churn.

## EDA Steps

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Load the provided datasets into a suitable environment for analysis. Handle missing data, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the data.

2. **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate summary statistics for relevant variables. This will help in understanding the basic distribution of data and identifying potential issues.

3. **Churn Rate Calculation:** Compute the churn rate by dividing the number of churned customers by the total number of customers. Visualize the churn rate to get a clear picture.

4. **Price Sensitivity Analysis:** Explore how pricing metrics relate to churn. Plot visualizations to understand the impact of pricing changes on churn behavior.

5. **Usage Patterns Exploration:** Create visualizations to uncover usage patterns. Are there specific usage behaviors that are associated with higher churn rates?

6. **Correlation Analysis:** Perform correlation analysis between churn and various features like pricing, usage, and sign-up dates. Identify which factors might be strongly correlated with churn.

7. **Data Visualization:** Create informative graphs and plots to present the findings visually. Visualizations could include histograms, scatter plots, line charts, and heatmaps.

## Conclusion

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will provide a foundation for understanding the relationship between customer churn and price sensitivity. By delving into historical customer data, pricing data, and churn indicators, we aim to uncover initial insights that will guide the subsequent steps in building an effective churn model. The outcomes of this EDA will help the BCG project team make informed decisions about feature selection, model building, and potential strategies for mitigating churn based on price sensitivity.
